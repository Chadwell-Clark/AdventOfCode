#Advent of Code- A great coding challenge -lots of parsing and logic
##Starting in 2015 and working my way through 
###In Late Nov of 2020, after beginning to teach myself Python I found Advent of Code
I struggled through about ten days, learning much and finally gave up after the challenges rose too high above my capabilities.
I can't wait for 2021 AoC but will make my way through as much as I can to stay fresh.
Right now I am working in JS, might do some C# and python. Ideally I will translate each soution in to all three. Maybe more languages as I learn them
